# SL_datasets

## Dataset Description
This dataset includes 1,023 Chinese words that are commonly used in daily interactions. We crafted 702 sign language sentences that are usually used among deaf. Under the guidance of sign language experts, 702 daily sign language sentences used by deaf people around the scenes of banks, schools, and hospitals are selected. Each sentence contains 3-10 sign language words. It should be noted that each word occurred more than 5 times in the 702 sentences.


## Collection Process
In this process, 20 volunteers were recruited to collect gesture signal samples. They ranged in age from 18 to 45, including 7 university students (6 males and 1 female), 9 deaf people (3 males and 6 females), and 4 sign language experts from the local special education center (2 males and 2 females).
Considering the privacy concerns of the deaf community, before collecting gesture signals, a manual for gesture signal collection is edited to inform volunteers what information needs to be collected. In this work, all volunteers involved in data collection have been aware of the collection process and the type of information collected. In collecting gesture data, only the signals of the deaf people performing gestures are collected, and no other privacy-related information, e.g. face, is collected. After data collection, the identity information, such as the name and gender of the volunteers is masked.


This warehouse has selected a batch of high-quality sign language samples from the original data set, which are executed and collected by sign language experts.

# MM-CSL_datasets

## Dataset Description
MM-CSL is a sign language dataset collected by ourselves with a Logitech C922x Pro Stream webcam and a MYO bracelet. The frame rate and resolution of the webcam are $60$fps and 1920*1080, respectively. MM-CSL contains 161 common sentences consisting of $ 297 $ sign words. The volunteers involved in the data collection included 11 volunteers (7 males and 4 males), both hearing people and hearing-impaired. Considering the deaf community privacy concerns, a manual for collecting sign signals was edited to inform volunteers of what information needed to be collected prior to collecting sign signals. The dataset was collected through two MYO bracelets and an RGB camera. In the process of data collection, the two MYO bracelets were worn on the volunteers' hands, respectively, to collect the sEMG signals and the IMU signals generated in the execution of sign language gestures. An RGB camera, which was placed 2.5 m in front of the volunteer, recorded the sign language movements performed by the volunteer by means of video. In particular, the frame rate and the pixels of the RGB camera are $60$fps and 1290*1080, respectively.

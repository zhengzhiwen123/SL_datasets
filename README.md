## Dataset Description
This dataset includes 1,023 Chinese words that are commonly used in daily interactions. We crafted 702 sign language sentences that are usually used among deaf. Under the guidance of sign language experts, 702 daily sign language sentences used by deaf people around the scenes of banks, schools, and hospitals are selected. Each sentence contains 3-10 sign language words. It should be noted that each word occurred more than 5 times in the 702 sentences.


## Collection Process
In this process, 20 volunteers were recruited to collect gesture signal samples. They ranged in age from 18 to 45, including 7 university students (6 males and 1 female), 9 deaf people (3 males and 6 females), and 4 sign language experts from the local special education center (2 males and 2 females).
Considering the privacy concerns of the deaf community, before collecting gesture signals, a manual for gesture signal collection is edited to inform volunteers what information needs to be collected. In this work, all volunteers involved in data collection have been aware of the collection process and the type of information collected. In collecting gesture data, only the signals of the deaf people performing gestures are collected, and no other privacy-related information, e.g. face, is collected. After data collection, the identity information, such as the name and gender of the volunteers is masked.


This warehouse has selected a batch of high-quality sign language samples from the original data set, which are executed and collected by sign language experts.
